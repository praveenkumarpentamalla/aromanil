            <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;"> Crude oil, often referred to as petroleum, is a fossil fuel formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient marine organisms. It is a thick, dark liquid that serves as the foundation for various essential products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and plastics. Extracted from underground reservoirs, crude oil is a valuable global commodity that plays a pivotal role in the energy industry. Its refining and processing into various products are critical to the modern world's transportation, manufacturing, and energy needs. However, the extraction, transportation, and use of crude oil also raise environmental concerns due to its association with greenhouse gas emissions and oil spills.</p>
